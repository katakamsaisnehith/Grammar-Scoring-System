GRAMMAR-SCORING SYSTEM

This project is an AI-powered Grammar Scoring System that evaluates spoken English grammar using both traditional machine learning and Generative AI (GenAI) techniques. The system processes audio responses, transcribes them into text using a powerful speech-to-text model, extracts meaningful features, and predicts a grammar score between 1 to 5.
