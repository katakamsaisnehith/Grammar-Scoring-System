Grammar Scoring System

This project is an AI-powered Grammar Scoring System that evaluates spoken English grammar using both traditional machine learning and Generative AI (GenAI) techniques. The system processes audio responses, transcribes them into text using a powerful speech-to-text model, extracts meaningful features, and predicts a grammar score between 1 to 5.

Motivation
Human-like assessment of spoken grammar is challenging and time-consuming. This project uses GenAI-powered models to automate and improve the quality of such assessments. It can assist teachers, evaluators, and learners with scalable and consistent grammar feedback.
